"Well in my opinion it is a very good app, because it is a very good way to communicate while far away, you can send audios, and I find it incredible that they have added the audio to video image. But there is a fault and I don't know if it is the internet or the app, but when I make a video call with a friend, it tells me that I have a ""weak connection"" when in reality I have a good internet, and just when that notice appears the person I'm talking to sounds choppy and looks blurry."
Update the states part, or go back to how it was. It is unnecessary to see all those channels taking up so much space when in reality they do not interest us. What is of interest is in any case the statuses, but now we cannot see a preview of the status nor can we see the time it was uploaded, we necessarily have to open it and that is annoying. To see the contacts' faces, we see them in the contact, not in the states. And horizontally it is fatal without harmony with the phone screen.
I strongly ask you to make the voice notes a little better or similar to WhatsApp, I am left-handed and it is really very difficult for me to go back because it becomes direct to answer when I click on the left, ALSO, if I just want to return them a little I can't Hit it with a touch because it pauses and when you slide it practically starts from the beginning! I would truly appreciate it if you would take my request into account, honestly it is a REAL BUSINESS and I think not only for me. THANK YOU!.
